# MVP Risk Analysis: Habit Tracker App

**Document Date:** 2025-08-22  
**Analyst:** Business Analyst Mary  
**Source:** Advanced Elicitation on Brainstorming Session Results  
**Focus:** Next Steps Towards MVP Production

## High-Priority Risks

### üö® Technical Architecture Risks

**Database schema complexity**: Dual-purpose habits create complex many-to-many relationships between habits, goals, and health categories that could lead to performance issues at scale

**React Native + Supabase integration gaps**: Real-time notifications for weekly health snapshots may hit Supabase rate limits or require custom backend logic

**Data migration challenges**: Once users have data, changing the dual-purpose habit model becomes extremely difficult

### üë• User Adoption Risks

**Maintenance-first philosophy rejection**: Users accustomed to traditional habit trackers may find the "foundation bedrock" concept confusing or preachy

**Evaluation fatigue earlier than expected**: Even monthly evaluations might be too frequent if users have complex habit portfolios

**Onboarding complexity**: Explaining goal vs maintenance distinction requires significant user education that could increase drop-off

### ‚è∞ Timeline and Resource Risks

**6-8 week MVP timeline is aggressive**: Dual-purpose system + priority dashboard + evaluation cycles is substantial functionality for 2 months

**Parallel development assumption**: User testing "during MVP development" assumes you can recruit and coordinate testers while building - resource conflict likely

**Design-development dependencies**: Visual design system (3-4 weeks) overlapping with development could create blocking dependencies

## Medium-Priority Risks

### üìä Data Quality Issues

**Weekly health snapshot gaming**: Users may provide socially desirable responses rather than honest self-assessment

**Habit logging inconsistency**: "In the red" prioritization only works if users consistently log activities - no backup plan for missing data

### üéØ Product-Market Fit Risks

**Differentiation vs complexity trade-off**: The maintenance-first concept could be seen as over-engineering a simple habit tracking need

**Target audience unclear**: Document doesn't specify whether targeting productivity enthusiasts, wellness seekers, or general consumers

## Overlooked Implementation Challenges

### üîî Notification Strategy Gap

**Weekly health snapshot timing**: Sunday evening conflicts with family time for many users

**No mention of notification permissions**: iOS/Android notification approval critical for core functionality

### üí∞ Cost Structure Blindspot

**Supabase scaling costs**: Real-time features and user data storage costs not estimated

**No monetization strategy**: MVP has no revenue model to sustain development beyond initial build

### üì± Mobile-First Execution Risks

**Cross-platform consistency**: React Native styling differences between iOS/Android could affect priority dashboard color theming

**Offline functionality**: No mention of what happens when users can't sync data

## Recommended Risk Mitigation Actions

1. **Create technical proof-of-concept** for dual-purpose habit data model before full development
2. **Start user interviews immediately** to validate maintenance-first concept before building
3. **Define minimum data requirements** for priority dashboard to function with incomplete logging
4. **Establish Supabase cost monitoring** and usage thresholds
5. **Create simplified onboarding flow** that teaches concept through interaction, not explanation

## Next Steps

This risk analysis should be reviewed alongside the original brainstorming session results to inform:
- Revised timeline estimates
- Resource allocation priorities
- Technical architecture decisions
- User testing strategy refinements
