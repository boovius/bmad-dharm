# MVP Scope Recommendations: Habit Tracker App

**Document Date:** 2025-08-22  
**Analyst:** Business Analyst Mary  
**Source:** Project Brief Elicitation - MVP Minimalist Challenge  
**Focus:** Lean Startup Approach to Scope Reduction

## Core Hypothesis to Test

**Primary Assumption:** Users want their habit tracking app to prioritize maintenance habits over goal-oriented habits.

**Validation Approach:** This fundamental assumption should be tested before building complex dual-purpose systems.

## Recommended Scope Reductions

### Feature Simplifications

**Weekly Health Snapshots**
- **Current scope**: 3-5 questions on mental/physical/spiritual health with 1-10 scales
- **MVP reduction**: Single weekly question "How's your foundation this week?" (1-10 scale)
- **Rationale**: Tests core concept without evaluation fatigue

**Monthly Habit Evaluations**
- **Current scope**: Effectiveness (1-10) and difficulty (Easy/Medium/Hard) assessments
- **MVP reduction**: Defer entirely to Phase 2
- **Rationale**: Focus MVP on core habit tracking and prioritization

**Visual Theming Complexity**
- **Current scope**: Nuanced urgency gradients and sophisticated color theming
- **MVP reduction**: Simple red/yellow/green traffic light system
- **Rationale**: Communicates priority without complex design investment

**Dual-Purpose Habit System**
- **Current scope**: Habits can serve both goal and maintenance functions simultaneously
- **MVP reduction**: Binary classification - habit is either goal OR maintenance
- **Rationale**: Simpler to build, easier to understand, still tests core philosophy

## Minimal Viable Test

### Essential Features for Hypothesis Validation

1. **Habit Classification**
   - Binary choice on habit creation: Goal or Maintenance
   - Clear labeling and visual distinction

2. **Priority Dashboard**
   - Maintenance habits displayed first
   - Goal habits displayed second
   - "In the red" urgency indicators

3. **Basic Logging**
   - Simple tap-to-complete functionality
   - Daily habit status tracking

4. **Foundation Health Indicator**
   - Single weekly check-in: "How's your foundation?" (1-10)
   - Simple trend visualization

### Pre-Build Validation Opportunities

**Paper Prototype Testing**
- Mockup maintenance-first dashboard concept
- Test user reaction to priority ordering
- Validate terminology and mental models

**Landing Page Experiment**
- A/B test messaging: "Foundation-first habit tracking" vs traditional approaches
- Measure sign-up conversion rates
- Collect qualitative feedback on concept appeal

**User Interview Protocol**
- Test assumption that users experience goal/maintenance conflict
- Validate that users want app guidance on balance
- Assess willingness to prioritize maintenance habits

## Phased Development Strategy

### Phase 1 (MVP): Foundation Concept Validation
- **Timeline**: 4-6 weeks
- **Goal**: Prove users want maintenance-first prioritization
- **Features**: Classification, priority dashboard, basic logging, weekly check-in

### Phase 2: Enhanced Foundation Features
- **Timeline**: 6-8 weeks post-MVP
- **Goal**: Rich foundation health insights
- **Features**: Multi-question health snapshots, trend analysis, habit evaluations

### Phase 3: Dual-Purpose Sophistication
- **Timeline**: 8-12 weeks post-Phase 2
- **Goal**: Advanced habit relationship management
- **Features**: Dual-purpose habits, goal attachment, LLM recommendations

## Risk Mitigation Through Scope Reduction

### Technical Risk Reduction
- **Database complexity**: Simpler schema with binary classification
- **React Native challenges**: Focus on basic mobile patterns
- **Supabase integration**: Minimal real-time requirements

### User Adoption Risk Reduction
- **Onboarding simplicity**: Single classification decision vs complex dual-purpose explanation
- **Feature overwhelm**: Focused feature set reduces cognitive load
- **Value demonstration**: Core value visible immediately

### Resource Risk Reduction
- **Development timeline**: 4-6 weeks vs 6-8 weeks for full scope
- **Design requirements**: Simple visual system vs complex theming
- **Testing complexity**: Fewer variables to validate

## Success Metrics for MVP

### Validation Metrics
- **User preference**: Do users actually use maintenance-first priority ordering?
- **Behavior change**: Do users log maintenance habits more consistently when prioritized?
- **Concept resonance**: Qualitative feedback on foundation metaphor
- **Retention**: Do users continue using maintenance-first approach beyond trial period?

### Technical Metrics
- **Performance**: Simple classification system performance
- **Usability**: Completion rates for basic logging flows
- **Reliability**: Core functionality uptime and error rates
