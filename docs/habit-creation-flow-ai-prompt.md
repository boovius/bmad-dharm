# CONTEXT: FoundationFirst Habit Creation Flow

You are building a React Native mobile application called "FoundationFirst" that helps users manage habits using a maintenance-first philosophy. This app prioritizes foundation/maintenance habits (sleep, stress management, social connection) over goal habits, as maintenance habits serve as the foundation for successful goal achievement.

## TECH STACK
- React Native (iOS 14+ and Android 8+)
- Cross-platform consistency required
- Offline-first functionality with sync capability
- WCAG AA accessibility compliance
- 60fps animation performance target

## VISUAL DESIGN SYSTEM
- **Colors**: Primary #4A7C59, Secondary #7FAAA3, Foundation #8B7355, Success #5E9C4F, Warning #E69138, Error #D84315
- **Typography**: Inter font family, mobile-optimized scale (H1: 24px, Body: 16px)
- **Spacing**: 4px base unit system (4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40px increments)
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44pt for accessibility
- **Animations**: Gentle, purposeful, calm confidence aesthetic

# HIGH-LEVEL GOAL
Create a complete habit creation flow component that guides users through classifying habits as either "Goal" or "Maintenance" with clear educational examples, appropriate weekly target setting, and seamless integration with the main priority dashboard.

# DETAILED STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS

1. **Create the main HabitCreationFlow component** that manages the multi-step process with navigation between steps
2. **Implement Step 1: Habit Name Input** with clean text input, validation, and continue button
3. **Build Step 2: Classification Choice** using side-by-side cards for "Goal" vs "Maintenance" selection with expandable examples
4. **Add Classification Examples** that show persona-relevant suggestions:
   - Maintenance: "Sleep 7+ hours", "Daily stress check-in", "Connect with friends/family", "Take breaks during work"
   - Goal: "Learn Spanish 20 min", "Exercise 3x/week", "Read 1 book/month", "Save $200/month"
5. **Create Step 3: Weekly Target Setting** with smart defaults based on classification (Maintenance: 5-7 days, Goals: 3-5 days)
6. **Implement Step 4: Optional Description** with expandable text area that doesn't interrupt flow for quick users
7. **Build Review & Confirmation** screen showing all selections with ability to go back and edit
8. **Add Success State** with gentle confirmation and smooth transition back to priority dashboard
9. **Include Progress Indicator** showing current step (1/4, 2/4, etc.) with accessible navigation
10. **Implement proper navigation** with back buttons, gesture support, and proper focus management
11. **Add form validation** with helpful error states that guide rather than criticize
12. **Integrate with dashboard** by properly passing new habit data back to parent component

# CODE EXAMPLES & CONSTRAINTS

## Classification Cards Example Structure:
```jsx
<ClassificationSelector>
  <ClassificationCard
    type="maintenance"
    title="Maintenance Habit"
    subtitle="Your daily foundation"
    examples={maintenanceExamples}
    selected={classification === 'maintenance'}
    onSelect={() => setClassification('maintenance')}
  />
  <ClassificationCard
    type="goal"
    title="Goal Habit"
    subtitle="Something you're building toward"
    examples={goalExamples}
    selected={classification === 'goal'}
    onSelect={() => setClassification('goal')}
  />
</ClassificationSelector>
```

## API Integration Requirements:
- POST to `/api/habits` with payload: `{ name: string, classification: 'goal'|'maintenance', weeklyTarget: number, description?: string }`
- Handle offline creation with local storage fallback
- Show loading states during habit creation
- Provide error handling with retry options

## Accessibility Requirements:
- Screen reader labels for all interactive elements
- Logical tab order through the flow
- Focus management when navigating between steps
- High contrast mode support
- Support for 200% text scaling

## Animation Guidelines:
- Step transitions: 300ms ease-out slide animations
- Classification selection: 150ms scale animation (1.0 → 1.05 → 1.0)
- Success confirmation: gentle fade-in with subtle scale from 0.95 → 1.0
- Support `prefers-reduced-motion` with immediate transitions

## Color Usage:
- Maintenance habits: Use Foundation color (#8B7355) for emphasis
- Goal habits: Use Secondary color (#7FAAA3) 
- Selected states: Primary color (#4A7C59)
- Error states: Error color (#D84315) with gentle presentation

# STRICT SCOPE DEFINITION

**CREATE ONLY:**
- `HabitCreationFlow.jsx` - Main flow component
- `ClassificationSelector.jsx` - Step 2 classification choice
- `WeeklyTargetSelector.jsx` - Step 3 target setting
- `HabitCreationStep.jsx` - Reusable step wrapper component
- `styles/habitCreation.js` - Styling for all habit creation components

**INTEGRATE WITH:**
- Add the HabitCreationFlow to the existing priority dashboard navigation
- Ensure new habits appear immediately in dashboard with proper classification

**DO NOT MODIFY:**
- Any existing dashboard components
- Navigation components outside this flow
- User authentication or data persistence logic beyond habit creation
- Any onboarding or tutorial components

**REQUIREMENTS:**
- Full TypeScript types for all props and state
- Comprehensive error handling for network failures
- Offline-first habit creation with sync indicators
- Support for both iOS and Android platform-specific behaviors
- Proper cleanup of form state when flow completes or is cancelled

**TESTING CONSIDERATIONS:**
- Include accessible roles and testIDs for automated testing
- Handle edge cases: slow networks, classification confusion, input validation
- Support users who might abandon mid-flow and return later
- Ensure haptic feedback works appropriately on both platforms

Remember: This flow should feel supportive and educational rather than demanding. Users should understand the maintenance-first philosophy through interaction, not through lengthy explanations. The interface should guide them naturally toward creating a good mix of maintenance and goal habits for a strong foundation.

## Usage Notes

This prompt follows the proven four-part framework:

1. **High-Level Goal**: Clear objective for creating the complete habit creation flow
2. **Detailed Instructions**: 12 specific, numbered steps breaking down the complex flow
3. **Code Examples & Constraints**: React Native code snippets, API contracts, accessibility requirements, and design system specifications
4. **Strict Scope**: Precisely defined file boundaries and integration points

**Important**: All AI-generated code will require careful human review, testing, and refinement to be considered production-ready. This prompt provides a strong foundation, but validate the accessibility implementation, test across devices, and ensure the educational aspects effectively teach the maintenance-first concept to users.
